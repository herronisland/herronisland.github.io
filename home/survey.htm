<i>(6/7/2008)</i>&nbsp; HMC has recently contracted with Aspen Surveying to survey the roads throughout the island in preparation for locating where utility trenches will be placed when installing the new water distribution system.  Aspen is marking survey control points (these are not boundaries) with metal rods, wood stakes and other markings as they progress along the roads.  Please do not disturb or remove any of these markers.  Any that are damaged or removed will cost HMC additional funds as they slow the surveyor's work on the project.
