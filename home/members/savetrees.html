<font size="+1">Did you know that you can agree to waive your paper copy of the Beachcomber<br> for regular issues, and read and/or print the newsletter online?<br><br>

Why should you do this?  Because if even 1/4 of the members (about 90) sign up,<br> we'll save $650 a year, money that can be spent on the website,<br> the parks or other needed improvements!  If we can get more than 90 members,<br> we can increase our savings even more.<br><br>

What about ballots and ballot envelopes?  Any issue of the Beachcomber<br> which includes a ballot <i><b>must</b></i> be sent by First Class (Snail) Mail,<br> so don't worry, you'll still receive a printed copy anytime there is a ballot enclosed.<br><br>

To sign up to read your Beachcombers online, just click here:<br>
