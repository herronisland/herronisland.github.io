<A name="Background"><font color="#00ff00"><b>III.	BACKGROUND</b></font color><br><br>
Herron Island is a unique place.  The Island is completely privately owned, with no public access.  Our HMC ferry, the Charlie Wells, provides transportation to and from the Island for property owners, renters, guests, and utility and emergency vehicles.  Most of the Island's area consists of lots owned by individual property owners.  The remainder consists of common areas such as parks, roads, and parking areas and a few individual lots, all of which are owned by HMC.  A Board of Trustees controls and manages the assets and business affairs of HMC for the benefit of its members.<br><br>

Herron Island is a special place in other ways as well.  The water, the beaches, the woods and wetlands, the open spaces, and the views of the mountains and Case Inlet make it a place of great natural beauty.  The deer are a delight to residents and visitors alike.  Birds and marine life can be observed in their natural habitat.  Fishing, boating, sailing, water skiing, and other water sports are enjoyed by many.  Most of the property owners were first attracted to the Island by these qualities and the quiet, peaceful environment.  These are characteristics which we all wish and intend to preserve and maintain.  The rules and regulations that follow are necessary to accomplish this objective.<br><br>

The By-Laws of HMC, Article VI, Section 3, give the Board the responsibility and the authority to establish such rules and regulations as they deem best, provided they are not inconsistent with Washington and United States laws, with regulations and ordinances of Pierce County, or with the By-Laws and Articles of Incorporation of HMC.  The Pierce County Sheriff Department maintains the same authority and responsibility for law enforcement on the Island as it does throughout the rest of the County, responds to calls for assistance, and visits the Island periodically.<br><br>

The objective of the Board has been to establish only such rules and regulations as are:<br><br>
1)	necessary and appropriate in regard to the use, care, operation, maintenance, and preservation of HMC common areas and facilities; or are<br><br>
2)	necessary for the health and safety of members, renters, guests, and employees; or are<br><br>
3)	necessary to preserve the rights of members to the full use and enjoyment of their property and/or Island facilities and to prevent infringement on these rights by others.<br><br>

			b.	If sufficient grounds are found, the Rules Committee shall notify the member(s) involved and any renter who is also believed to be responsible for such violation (collectively referred to hereafter as respondents), in writing of such specific violation, which notice shall state that the respondents have the right to appear before the Committee with regard to the claims set forth in the notice of violation.  The notice shall also state that if the respondents fail to deliver written notice to the Committee within 15 days from receipt of notice of violation, requesting such an informal hearing, the Committee may impose a fine or other penalty as set forth in Section C that follows below.<br><br>

			c.	If the respondents request an informal hearing, the Committee shall schedule such hearing and shall provide the respondents with at least 10 days written notice as to the date, time, and place thereof.  At the hearing the respondents shall have the opportunity to discuss with the Committee the merits of the claims set forth in the notice of violation.  Any other person having information bearing on whether or not a violation has been committed shall also present the same at the hearing.  At the conclusion of the hearing, or if the respondents fail to appear at the hearing, the Committee shall determine whether or not a violation has taken place, what fine or other penalty shall be levied against any or all the respondents, and the time within which any fine must be paid.  The decision shall be confirmed in writing to the respondents within seven days after the hearing.<br><br>

			d.	Respondents may request a hearing before the Board to appeal a decision by the Rules Committee.  Such request must be in writing and be received by the Board within 15 days after the decision by the Rules Committee.  Any member of the Board who is incapable of impartial, disinterested, and objective consideration of the case shall disclose such to the Board and remove himself or herself from participation in the proceedings and have it so recorded in the minutes.  At the hearing, respondents will have the opportunity to present any information bearing on the matter.  The Board will also review the decision of the Rules Committee.  The Board will make its decision and report it in writing to the respondents within 7 days after the hearing.  The decision of a majority of the Board members who were present at the hearing will be binding upon the respondents and upon HMC.<br><br>

			e.	The Board shall cause to be kept records of the pertinent documents, data, and minutes of meetings relating to each case where a notice of violation has been sent to respondents.<br><br>

		3.	Continuing failure to comply with a provision of the rules and regulations or a Board decision shall be sufficient grounds for an action to recover sums due for damages, which shall include any fines levied by the Board and any costs incurred by HMC in connection with the proceedings before the Board, maintainable by HMC (acting through the Board) on behalf of the members.  Such failure shall further be grounds for the issuance of injunctive relief in such an action.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed as a waiver of HMC's right to bring an action without first exhausting HMC's internal enforcement procedures in cases where the Board deems immediate legal action to be necessary or appropriate.  If HMC prevails in any such action, it shall be entitled to recover as part of its judgment a reasonable sum for attorneys' fees reasonably incurred in connection with the action, in addition to taxable costs permitted by law.<br><br>
