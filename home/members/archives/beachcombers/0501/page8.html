<p>As part of the federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996, drinking water
providers are required to furnish a Consumer Confidence Report to their
customers on an annual basis beginning in 1999. The purpose of this report is to
tell you about your water, where your water comes from and how it compares to
stringent standards set by regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to
contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of
contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More
information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by
calling the EPA뭩 Safe Water Drinking Water Hotline (800-426-4791).</p>
<p>Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the
general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer who
are undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants,
people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants
can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice
about drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines about
drinking water from their health care providers. EPA/CDC guidelines on
appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium or other
microbial contaminants are available from the Safe Water Drinking Hotline
(800-426-4791).</p>
<p>Contaminants that may be present in source water before we treat it include:</p>

  <blockquote>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Microbial contaminants, such as viruses and
  bacteria, which may come from sewage treatment plants, septic systems,
  agriculture, livestock operations and wildlife.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Inorganic contaminants, such as salts and metals,
  which can be naturally-occurring or result from urban stormwater runoff,
  industrial or domestic wastewater discharges, oil and gas production, mining
  or farming.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Pesticides and herbicides, which may come from a
  variety of sources such as agriculture and residential uses.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Radioactive contaminants, which are naturally
  occurring.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Organic chemical contaminants, including synthetic
  and volatile organic chemicals, which are the by-products of industrial
  processes and petroleum production, and can also come from gas stations, urban
  stormwater runoff, and septic systems.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include
rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs and wells. As water travels
over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally
occurring minerals and in some cases, radioactive material and can pick up
substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activity.</p>
<p>Your water comes from a single well field. After the water comes from the
wells it is distributed to your home without treatment. Listed below are results
of water quality monitoring reports for the year 2000.</p>
<p>CONTAMINANTS BELOW MCL VIOLATION COMMENTS</p>
<p>INORGANIC CON. YES NO nd</p>
<p>VOLATILE ORGANIC YES NO nd</p>
<p>INSECTICIDES YES NO nd</p>
<p>GENERAL PESTICIDES YES NO nd</p>
<p>HERBICIDES YES NO nd</p>

  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG): the level
  of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected
  risk to health. MCLG뭩 allow for a margin of safety.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL): the level of a
  contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCL뭩 are set as close to the
  MCLG뭩 as feasible using the best available treatment technology.</p>
  </font><font FACE="Symbol" SIZE="2">
  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">Action Level (AL): the concentration of a
  contaminant which, when exceeded, triggers treatment or other requirements
  which a water system must follow.</p>

  <p> </font><font SIZE="2">N/A: not applicable *nd: not detectable at testing
  limit *ppb: parts per billion or micrograms per liter *ppm: parts per million
  or milligrams per liter *pCi/1: picocuries per liter (a measure of radiation).</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, coliform bacteria tests were conducted once per month with no
colonies detected.</p>
<p>In summary, the water withdrawn from your wells is very high quality. It is
virtually free from natural or manmade contaminants.</p>
