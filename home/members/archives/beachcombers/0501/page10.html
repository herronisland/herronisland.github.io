<p>CANDIDATE: <b>Janet Podell</p>
</b></font></u><font FACE="Albertus Medium" SIZE="1">
<p>My name is Janet Podell and I have been a member of the Herron Island
community for two years. I hope to build a cabin on my small lot at the south
end of the island and eventually retire there. Over these past two years I have
really come to appreciate what a remarkable and magical place Herron Island is,
and feel that I can offer some of my personal time to help contribute to its
successful operation. For the past year I have been serving on the Finance and
Communication committees and through this involvement have experienced a glimpse
of the how the island is managed. As a Board Member I would have exposure to the
other operational components which keep the island running smoothly and perhaps
could utilize some of the business skills I have acquired over the years for the
benefit of this community. I believe that Herron Island is a beautiful and
unique place that continues to need the stewardship of people who are committed
to maintaining is viability.</p>
<p>Experience and Skills</p>
<p>I have worked for The Boeing Company for 14 years as a Buyer and Procurement
Manager. I currently manage a group of Buyers who are responsible for the
purchase of various supplies and services for Boeing facilities. This computes
to about $150+ million per year over which I have direct responsibility. My
procurement and business experience actually precedes Boeing by about 13 years.
I worked in the Aerospace industry in Southern California during those previous
years and bring a total of 27 years of business experience to the table.
Additionally, over the course of my career I have managed process improvement
teams and developed employee recognition programs. I have strong communication
skills and pride myself on being organized. The nature of the work I do also
requires me to hone and practice my problem solving skills on a daily basis.</p>
<u>
<p>In summary</p>
</u>
<p>I believe that a Board member should serve the community with skill,
commitment, and a high degree of common sense. I have observed the current and
past Boards and have witnessed first hand the talent, skill, and commitment they
bring to the table. I believe I possess some of the necessary attributes and
would be honored to serve as a Board member.</p>
