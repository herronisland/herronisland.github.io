The Herron Maintenance Co. is a non-profit, non stock, Washington Corporation consisting of the owners and purchasers of property on Herron Island.<br><br>

The officers of the corporation are unsalaried as are the directors.  The decision to form the Herron Maintenance Co. was made on the basis of experiences of the developers in subdivisions requiring a continuous maintenance program.  After sale of a subdivision has been completed, this type of organization has, in the past, proved very effective in providing purchasers with the means to continue the high standards of the recreational facilities originally provided by the developers.<br><br>

The Herron Island development is unique in that the entire island is privately owned and will be served by private roads and a private ferry system to maintain the exclusiveness which is one of the most appealing features of the Island.  Doing so, however leads to the responsibility on the part of the Island purchasers to maintain and operate these facilities free of public support.  We believe that the assurances of continuous maintenance and operation of fine community recreation facilities, roads docks and ferry system is best provided for by the creation of Herron Maintenance Co.<br><br>

The Development Company, at a considerable expense, has constructed two ferry docks.  The dock on the mainland side was constructed on land leased in the name of Herron Maintenance Co. from Pierce County for one dollar a year.  The dock on the Island side will be dedicated to the Herron Maintenance Co. and will likewise be dedicated to the use of the Herron Maintenance Co.  The several community parks and other community facilities will be turned over to the Maintenance Co. when the plans for the completion of these facilities have been carried out.<br><br>

Mr. Harold Patricio, who has made Herron Island his permanent home, has entered into an agreement with the Herron Maintenance Company to operate the ferry and take charge of the Maintenance Company facilities on the Island for a 10-year period.  We feel very fortunate in having him for this work since he has had wide experience as a ferry operator and will provide the day-to-day care necessary to properly maintain all Maintenance Co. facilities.<br><br>

As provided in the By-Laws of the Herron Maintenance Co., the annual assessment for each member is set at not to exceed $40 a year.  When all the property is sold, this assessment should produce an annual income for the Maintenance Company in excess of $16,000 a year.  We have made a careful study of the costs involved and we feel that this amount will be ample to insure operation and availability of ferry service, will cover the costs of maintaining the docks, roads, community parks and beaches with no charge to the members and their guests and will enable the Maintenance Company to set up a fund to cover depreciation of the various facilities.  The funds collected from members will be deposited in a trust fund handled by independent Certified Public Accountants and will remain the property of the individual members, pro rata, until expended.  As Maintenance Company expenses are incurred, they will be presented to the accounting firm and funds will be withdrawn from the Trust Account as necessary to pay the obligation.<br><br>

The Herron Development Co. is vitally concerned with the proper organization and operation of the Maintenance Co.  All organization cost, including legal and accounting services, have been provided at the cost of the Development Co.  The Development Co. also recognizes that certain costs will be incurred in connection with road maintenance, park and beach maintenance and ferry operation which cannot be fully paid for by the Maintenance Co. until substantially all properties are sold.  Since the members of the Development Co. sincerely believe that the proper organization and functioning of the Maintenance Co. is an absolute necessity, they will contribute funds as required until they are confident that the Maintenance Co. can take over its functions.<br><br>

All of the incorporators and officers of the Maintenance Co. are presently members of the Development Co.  While certain members of the Development Co. would like to remain active in the Maintenance Co. management through the period of sales, they urge active participation by all purchasers in the operation of the Maintenance Co. to the end that all functions of directing and managing the Maintenance Co. will be handled by the lot owners at the earliest possible time to insure a properly functioning organization after the sales program has been completed.<br><br>
