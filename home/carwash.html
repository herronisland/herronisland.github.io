Herron Island Feels the Habitat Spirit<br><br>
By Judy Greinke<br><br>

<i>Herron Island, a small private island nestled in Puget Sound waters decided to do something to aid the hurricane victims. The Herron Island Boosters club, a small group of volunteers, usually raises money for island improvements, but this time they decided to have a car wash with all proceeds going to Hurricane Relief efforts.
 It had been pouring rain for three days but the thought was that cars would not need to be dried if it was raining, so the car wash was going on—rain or shine.  As in most volunteer organizations the same few workers showed up for the event.<br><br>

People, mostly seniors, arrived with their hoses, buckets, squeegees, towels and soap early that Saturday morning. Some brought coffee and cookies.  One person cooked hot dogs for everyone.  When the towels were all wet someone went and got their leaf blower to help dry the cars.  Others gave window wash, plastic cleaners, Armor All, and food old-fashioned elbow grease, and all gave from their hearts..<br><br>

Before the first car was finished the sun started breaking through the clouds, and the unending stream of cars started. Spirits were high, everyone was laughing and having fun, and even the sun smiled of the group all day.
Now you need to know that Herron Island has dirt roads, so vehicles are always dirty, yet folks were willing to have their cars, trucks, and even golf carts washed.  What they wanted even more was to give to those in need, and when they heard that the money would go to Habitat for Humanity, they were inspired to give. The donations started growing right along with the high spirits and positive feeling of everyone involved.<br><br>

$800 was collected during the one day car wash.  Thank you, Herron Island Boosters Club!</i>
