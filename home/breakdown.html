<p><i>(8/7/07, 11:30 a.m.)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ferry system ramp damage update:  as of this morning, Tuesday, August 7, work is underway on the island ferry terminal.  Special parts were constructed on Sunday by an overtime crew at a company in Ohio.  These were then air-freighted to Seattle Sunday night and were at our vendor's shop on Monday, where they were assembled to other machinery.  All of this was brought to the island on the ferry this morning to be installed today by a crew using a large crane truck.  Because the island ramp is temporarily secured in place at a very high position the ferry can only be used to bring the machinery over, and the workers have to use a ladder to access the ramp.  Another vendor is today making up the approximately 600 feet of wire rope (steel cable) and connectors that are needed to operate the ramp.  We expect to have the cable installed tomorrow afternoon.  If everything goes as planned, the ferry may be in operation by late Thursday, but this is not a given at this time.<br><br>
 
Also at this time, we believe that the cause of the damage was a malfunctioning radio transmitter that may have shorted out and sent a signal to the ramp motor to start running continuously.  Further investigation into this will follow, and additional steps will need to be taken to prevent this type of malfunction from causing problems in the future.  In the twelve years that this remote control system for the ramps has been in operation on Herron Island there has not been a malfunction such as apparently occurred last Friday.

<p><i>(8/5/07, 12:10 p.m.)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Crewmembers, island volunteers and Cascade Machine and Electric crew removed the damaged dock winch.  Donnie ran parts and personnel from the mainland using his boat.  The Fire Department set up to respond by water during our ferry outage.  Thanks to the volunteers for the coffee, and helping hands.  Due to the use of Sam Argo’s tools and equipment the removal process time was cut immensely.  We appreciate you Sam!  Replacement parts are on order.<br><br>

<p><i>(8/4/07, 8:40 p.m.)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; Update on the Herron Island ferry ramp outage:  Major components of the ramp lifting system were destroyed when a motor began running late Friday night with no one present.  At this time the cause is undetermined.  The ramp has been stabilized and two vendors have been contracted to begin replacement of various components.  It is possible that work to put the ramp back in service may be completed by the end of the coming week, but that is dependent on how soon the components, some of which are specific to the ramp system, can be manufactured and put in place.  Further information will follow as it becomes available.<br><br>

<p><i>(8/4/07, 8:45 a.m.)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; At 10:30 p.m. on Friday, August 3rd, the island ferry dock ramp suffered an extremely serious mechanical breakdown.  Major parts will have to be ordered and installed.  We don't know the duration of the outage, but it may be as long as two weeks.<br><br>

We will update the information in this space as often as possible.  Please do not call the ferry cell phone, as it is being used for emergency repair communication. If you have an emergency requiring medical, fire, or police assistance, please continue to call 911.<br><br>
