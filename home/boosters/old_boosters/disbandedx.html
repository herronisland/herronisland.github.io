We had a fabulous turnout for our Potluck on Saturday night (May 14, 2011) with great food (and lots of it), motivated members, and lots of goodwill.  It was wonderful to reconnect as a community.  Everyone wants to restart our Island social events.  We've decided to start slow (so as not to overwhelm anyone) and are planning events for the next two upcoming holidays.  Memorial Day is rapidly approaching so we are moving out smartly with the planning.  Check back here often to get all the event details.  In the meantime <a href="../photos/boosters_may11/boosters_051411.html" target="_top"><font color="#0000ff">click here</font></a> to see some photos of the potluck event.  A great big <i><u>thank you</u></i> to everyone for helping to make it a wonderful success.  Community spirit is alive and well on Herron Island!</b> <br><br></div>

It was a wonderful Memorial Day weekend for Herron Islanders! Members, their guests, and a multitude of pets joined us in great numbers for the planned events. The spirit of the holiday was everywhere. Even the weather cooperated! The Baseball games were tons of fun, the Tailgate party was a rip roaring success, and the Sailboat races were fantastic with perfect wind conditions. Members were in good spirits and happy to be there. <a href="../photos/memorial11/memorial_052811.html"><font color="#0000ff">Click here</font></a> for some pictures of the events. And don’t forget to mark your calendar for more Boosters events over the July 4th holiday weekend. We’ll be having baseball games, the July 4th Parade, Sailboat races, a Fun Run, Live entertainment (a Jazz band), and community Fireworks at dusk on the 4th only at North Beach. Check back here often for details.
