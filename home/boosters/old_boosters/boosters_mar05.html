A special thank you to Judy Greinke for arranging the line dancing in February. It was a really fun time.  A special thank you also to our wonderful island musicians for providing musical selections for the March potluck. George Newcomb is truly gifted with the harmonica. He has been playing it since he was a young boy. Norma, his wife, gave him a score of 9.7 (out of 10) on his rendition of Taps on his bugle. David and Sina Clauson have super talents. They even rewrote the music for just their two instruments: clarinet and bassoon.  Denny Dubach and his friend, Don Ebenritter had a good ole time playing guitar. Denny sang a couple of neat songs. One of the ladies in the audience was heard saying that she remembered her father singing one of Denny’s songs. That certainly brought back some wonderful memories.<br><br>

Our first summer function is the Memorial weekend, May 28/29. We need a lot of help: the pancake breakfast, the flea market, selling the cinnamon rolls, etc.  If you have not volunteered in awhile, please help us this summer. No one event is more than a few hours. Even more importantly, it is fun. If you can help on the Memorial weekend, please call Kathy Deuster 253.884.6898.<br><br>

Please note:  the parade is in July only. There was an error in the Jan-Feb. Beachcomber.
