The Board of Directors of HMC Management has determined that HMC will no longer accept more than $2.00 in coin for payment of any fees or assessments, including ferry fees.  Amounts of coin in any one transaction greater than that create problems for both the ferry crew and the office in handling, counting and rolling coins for bank deposit.
