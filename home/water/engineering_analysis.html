The following engineering report, by Todd Krause of Northwest Water Systems, Inc., has been approved for posting on the Herron Island Website by the HMC Board of Directors.  Northwest Water was hired as a consultant to the water committee as part of the committee's work on the planned replacement of the island's water distribution system.  The report contains analysis and opinions stated by the writer.  It is input to the committee and does not represent an accepted position of either the water committee nor the Board of Directors.  Considerable additional work on this large project will have to be done before a final report to the membership is generated by the Board.
