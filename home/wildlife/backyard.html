A land we all love, yet one we may be smothering with our numbers. <B>Over
35,000 acres</B> of wildlife habitat is <B>lost</B> each year here in Washington,
a large majority due to housing and development. If we continue at this rate
our wildlife will have few places to live and visit. So the Washington Department
of Fish and Wildlife instituted the <FONT COLOR="Green"><B><em>Backyard Wildlife
Sanctuary Program</em></B></FONT> to help offset some of this habitat loss. While
many of us may not realize it, a property owner is also a habitat manager.
The things we do, or do not do, in the vicinity of our home have an effect
on the quality of habitat for dozens of wildlife species.
<P ALIGN=Left>
The Department of Fish and Wildlife wants to help you understand and appreciate
the wildlife around your home. You can make your property a better place
for songbirds and other wildlife species that have lived in your area long
before people began to settle.

<A NAME="improve"></A><FONT COLOR="Green" size=+2>Want to make your property
better for wildlife?</FONT> <P>
<strong>Consider these suggestions:</strong>
<OL>
  <LI>
    Plant more trees and shrubs. Remember, vegetation is the key to attracting
    a variety of wildlife. Dead trees (snags) are especially valuable to wildlife;
    try to keep them on your property if they pose no safety hazard.<BR>
  <LI>
    Add a birdbath or other source of water. A safe place to bathe and drink
    will act as a magnet to many animals.<BR>
  <LI>
    Add bird feeders. A feeder for millet, one for sunflower seeds, and one for
    suet will appeal to a wide variety of birds.<BR>
  <LI>
    Add bird houses, or better yet, try to leave snags on your property.
    Cavity-nesting birds have been especially hurt by urban development. A bird
    house of the proper dimensions can substitute for snags where these birds
    used to nest.<BR>
  <LI>
    Cover any openings under the eaves or other places around your house where
    house sparrows and starlings may nest. These non-native birds are undesirable
    competitors for food and nesting cavities and many native birds have suffered
    because of their presence. Bird houses and feeders should be designed and
    managed to reduce use by sparrows and starlings.<BR>
  <LI>
    Control cats that may be prowling around your sanctuary; they can be especially
    harmful to birds that feed or nest on the ground. Try putting a small bell
    around your cat's neck.<BR>
  <LI>
    Get your neighbors interested in backyard wildlife. Several adjacent yards
    with good wildlife resources are even more effective. Most wildlife species
    need areas larger than a single lot can provide. Remember, every homeowner
    is a habitat manager, and the collective actions of conscientious homeowners
    will benefit the wildlife that shares your living space.<BR>
