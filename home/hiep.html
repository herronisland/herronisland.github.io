Thanks to the committee members who called neighbors, checked on people with medical issues and helped secure the boat dock for the arrival of the fireboat. We do need to inform islanders and their guests parked on the outermost dock that in an emergency their boats will be moved. The fireboat is 40' and needs the entire dock.  Thanks for the cooperation of the boat owners that were parked there Saturday.<br><br> 
 
 Chief West has set up an immediate response to cover our needs, be it a ferry problem or a low tide issue. By launching the fireboat at Joemma park on the west side of Key Peninsula response time is very quick.  They parked the ambulance at N. Beach. Depending on the emergency, they can/will order a helicopter immediately.<br><br>  
 
All our training paid off, and all went very smoothly.<br>
