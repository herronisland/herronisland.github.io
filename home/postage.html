We have been advised by the Post Office that odd-shaped items in envelopes are not acceptable in letter-style envelopes at the single-piece first, third, or fourth-class rate because they could burst the envelope and damage mail-processing equipment or injure employees.  We are required to purchase special padded envelopes to mail more than 10 Guest Passes or 1 book of $5 tickets.  The cost of each envelope is $0.99 and postage is $1.06.  Therefore, we will have to charge the additional amount above a the standard envelope rate of $0.37.  The amount of the difference to be charged with an order is $1.68.
