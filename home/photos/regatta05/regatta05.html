DUCKY RACE Gary Soriano:  Grand Prize Winner<br><br>
BLINDMAN DINGHY RACE Canceled as only one team showed up.<br><br>
Let's make 4th of July race our biggest and best. It’s time to get your boats ready and be up for the challenge.  We could use donated dinghy boats for those who do not own one. Be ready Sunday at 2pm. TO DICK AND IPPUN MOWRY: Your official protest for the sailboat race to take place on SATURDAY at 2pm has been reviewed and accepted. Hope to see all the monohull and multihull boats ready to go. There will be a short five minute warning and a long blast at 2pm for the start.
