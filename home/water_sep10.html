A member recently sent a list of questions to the Board concerning the status of our USDA loan application and other upgrade related issues.  In the interest of keeping the membership up to date on this important project, the Board felt that the questions and answers should  be shared with the entire membership.  The attached two documents are the Board's response to the questions posed.  Members are encouraged to continue submitting their questions to the Board and/or the Water Project Committee.  We recently created a member input mailbox.  The address is: memberinput@herronisland.org
