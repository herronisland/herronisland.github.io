Please remember that cutting trees or doing any other work on HMC road rights-of-way, without first obtaining an Encroachment Permit issued by the Island Manager, is prohibited and constitutes a violation of the Rules.  The only exception to this is routine ditch maintenance work done by an owner along the street frontage of his or her property.  The right-of-way along most roads is typically 50 feet wide and the area traveled upon by vehicles is only a portion of the right-of-way.
