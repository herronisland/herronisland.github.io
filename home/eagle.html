<p><i>(8/10/07)</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;This morning an island pet was found dead on the roadside.  When the owner took him to the vet, they were told an eagle had picked him up, crushed and dropped him.  The vet said that this is the time of year when eagles are feeding their young and most likely mistook the dog for a rabbit.  The owners wanted to share this so other pet owners would have this knowledge.
