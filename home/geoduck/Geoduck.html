<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes it pays to stand outside the
carnival of life, to withdraw as a player and observe as if part of
the audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
human activity becomes no longer commonplace, predictable or even
boring… it becomes more a moment of wonder, hilarity, or education,
where what is routine for one person is education, or entertainment,
for another.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Herron
Island offers perfect opportunities for us to step back and observe
with the eyes of a child, as if seeing things for the first time,
whether these be real or
imagined.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The following

<P><CENTER>&nbsp;</CENTER></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">This year Memorial Weekend in the
Pacific Northwest witnessed one of the lowest tides for a long
while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These two events
coinciding drew out more than a few examples of that rare and unique
breed of adventurers… the intrepid "geoduck
hunters".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Geoducks
(pronounced "gooey-ducks"), illusive and dubiously-shaped clams… are
more politely known as the "elephant trunk" clam in Asian parts, but
are actually better described by a part of the male human anatomy for
western tastes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They are
considered a great delicacy, particularly in Japan, but they can only
be found and harvested in the Puget Sound region, increasing their
rarity value in the Sushi emporiums across the
Pacific.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Without a
shadow of a doubt, the geoduck is probably one of the most the most
revolting edible creatures on the planet… one that had to have been
created on one of God's off
days.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, then again…
there's always the taste that makes up for its other
deficiencies!</FONT></P>

         <P>
      </TD><TD>
         <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">With such a revolting
         appearance, perhaps the best thing about the geoduck is the
         fact that it can only be really detected during the kind of
         exceptionally low tides that witnessed our Memorial Day
         weekend.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
         geoduck's natural environment lies deep beneath the water,
         indeed deep beneath the sandy beds beneath the
         water.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even at
         low tides, the only real clue to a geoduck's presence is
         it's subtle protuberance that barely touches the top of the
         sand bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
         then it is well camouflaged by color and
         texture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>Clearly, if nothing else, the geoduck is most
         definitely not a show-off, preferring to remain hidden to
         all but the most trained eye.&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT>

      </TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER></P>

<P></div></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Another clue to the geoduck's presence
of course is its occasional squirting of fluid several feel straight
into the air from the sand's surface… as any unsuspecting,
short-wearing, beach wanderer will
attest!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The uninitiated
can be forgiven for confusing this large bursting stream of fluid for
that of the "horse clam", which acts
similarly.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes">&nbsp; </span>However, further investigations will reveal
that the snout of the geoduck contains two nostrils, whereas the
snout of the horse clam has one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The subtle, twin-nosed siphon of the
geoduck is merely the tip of an enormous iceberg, if the truth were
known.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Or shall we be
polite and imply an enormous "elephant's trunk", as opposed to other
more dubious suggestions!)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Essentially, it is a tube that travels vertically down beneath
the seabed, where it enters into the geoduck's shelled body two to
three feet below the surface.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, so sensitive is the siphon of the geoduck that should
they detect even the slightest hint of movement on the surface...i.e.
human invasion... then this crude extension will immediately shrink
back down below, leaving nothing but a darkened hole in the surface
of the sand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The geoduck
is therefore not an easy creature to snare... should you ever choose
to do it that is?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
geoduck is, in fact, a sneaky critter, which requires the most speedy
and persistent actions of a seasoned hunter to snag
it<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></FONT>
</P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Were geoduck's equipped with sufficient
brains to be aware of the dangers of such a low tide event such as
Memorial Day they would, no doubt, vacation elsewhere during the
holiday period.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fortunately for the geoduck goaled however, being a quite
primitive creature, the stubborn geoduck remains where it is… which
does nothing but encourage their potential demise through such
unconscious recklessness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even so, the geoduck is not easy pickings… just, apparently,
shortsighted pickings.</FONT></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Now enter Max Hochanadel, an
         intrepid geoduck hunter from the Herron Island
         community.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Max
         has the admirable pedigree for being able to ferret out the
         undesirable from the
         inaccessible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>(Clearly his ex-attorney skills have prepared him
         well.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
         tide is low, as it was on the holiday weekend, Max reveals
         himself as a man with a
         mission.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>Indeed, it's even safe to say that Max is a giant
         amongst gooey duck hunters.<span style="mso-spacerun:
         
         
         
yes">&nbsp; </span>(In fact, I think
         it's also safe to say that Max is a giant amongst most men,
         as his six-foot plus frame
         attest.)<span style="mso-spacerun:
         
         
         
yes">&nbsp; </span>Max knows how to
         sniff a geoduck from mile
         away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He not
         only knows how to sniff them out… but also how to stake them
         out, dig them up and chow them down when the time is
         right.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </FONT></P>
         
         <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">When it comes to the actual
         attack, Max demonstrates that a moment wasted is a moment
         lost, especially when the shovel first bears down on the
         surface of the sand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
         
         
         
yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence,
         Max digs like fury when primed to
         attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
         method of attack is quite
         simple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
         </span>Stealth and determination mark the initial stages…
         eagle-eyed homing-in on his kill, driving in a trusty wooden
         stake to mark the whereabouts of the fated
         geoduck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
         shovel in hand, his assault on the geoduck lair and his
         subsequently extracting it rudely from that lair, is nothing
         short of
         awe-inspiring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>His speed of digging is almost a blur.</FONT>

         <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">The process of geoduck hunting
         is well documented.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>First, a hole is dug in the sand where the geoduck is
         located, with a radius of about a foot all round
         it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This hole
         is then dug to a depth of about two feet, the hunter barely
         stopping even for
         breath.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Slower
         geoducks have been known to remain during this ferocious
         dig.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
         invariably proves to be an unwise tactic as it risks
         decapitation by the shovel blade and certain
         death.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
         a geoduck that has more of its wits about it will speedily
         withdraw his precious siphon... burying his head in sand, so
         to speak… hoping the impertinent threat above will go
         away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The even
         smarter geoduck might even attempt to burrow deeper into the
         sand, to avoid the hunter's
         grasp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But few
         do, ultimately… unless trained like an Olympic sprinter on
         steroids.&nbsp;<o:p>

</span>Several hours later I joined Max, his family and his friends
to taste their legendary geoduck
chowder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It had been a
casual remark by Max but I was soon to learn that this was typical
off his big-hearted generosity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I chanced to mention that I had never even tasted a geoduck,
so he and his family immediately invited my wife Meredith and I to
come over and taste theirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it turned out, although the visit was later than I had
anticipated Max, his wife and guests were all at the beginning of
their dinner.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes">&nbsp; </span>The last thing I like doing is interrupt folks
at dinner (we absolutely refuse to answer the phone at such times
ourselves) but Max and the family were
unphased.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A space was
duly cleared for me at the table (Meredith was not with me as she had
to watch over the kids on the North Beach) and instead of six for
dinner there was now seven.&nbsp;<o:p> </o:p> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Actually, the others had already
consumed the geoduck chowder, for there were spotlessly empty bowls
before them when I arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, before I could even say "sorry to inconvenience you
guys" a hot bowl of the legendary chowder had suddenly appeared in
front of me… its delivery was accompanied with the words "Be careful,
it's hot" and "I'm afraid it it's a bit
chewy".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, I was
beyond such warnings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here before me lay the spoils of the day's hunting
party...<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>like a sacred
and time-honored elixir for all that ails
you.<span style="mso-spacerun:



yes">&nbsp; </span>I hurriedly, and hungrily, lifted the spoon to
my lips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First a sip, to
avoid burning the tongue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then the whole spoonful... hot but not too
hot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then the
chew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It proved accurate
for my hosts to say it was
"chewy".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It most
certainly was… but not enough so as to make it impossible to
eat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the struggle
of living geoduck to resist the hunter's grip, so too the taste of
the conquered geoduck made it's eater fight to savor the
taste.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But what a
taste!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>geoduck chowder,
excellently cooked within a few hours of the hunt, is the most
wonderful thing to behold.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well worthy of the remorseless tussle its hunter had to affect
its ultimate demise.</FONT>&nbsp;<o:p></P>

         <P><FONT FACE="Comic Sans MS">Max, an ever-present twinkle
         in his eye that confirms he knows exactly the joys of being
         experienced, smiled broadly at my
         pleasure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
         declared "It was good… wonderful!" and he accepted the
         complement graciously.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
         </span>He could see that here was yet another convert to the
         low tide tradition that graces this part of the world,
         unique amongst all
         others.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
         couldn't contain the not-so-small satisfaction that I too
         felt when sampling the well-cooked
         geoduck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
         all, wasn't it this very same geoduck that had peed all over
         at my shirt just as few hours
         earlier?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now
         here I was, in full enjoyment… willingly appreciating the
         great sacrifice that this humble creature had
         made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
         somewhat smug in my culinary "seventh heaven",
         yes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But I
         couldn't help reminding myself that the geoduck had somewhat
         of the last laugh… through the fact that, throughout the
         dinner, I constantly had to cover up the embarrassing
         geoduck pee stains (which I had forgotten about on my shirt)
         lest it should offend my new-found friends around the dinner
         table!</FONT>
