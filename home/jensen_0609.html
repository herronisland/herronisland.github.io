On May 12th a maple tree snapped in half and knocked down another tree and a power pole on East Herron Blvd.  The power lines and transformer all came down and we had no power for 15 hours.  Pen Light did a good repair job.  The transformer leaked its fluid onto the ground, damaging the asphalt.  No homes were hit, but a major mess was cleaned up by island personnel.  Thanks to Dick Mowry for clearing the downed trees so that the power company could replace the pole and transformer.  <a href="http://www.kodakgallery.com/ShareLanding.action?c=7ht37d95.83iv00ih&x=0&y=-xo0m22&localeid=en_US&cm_mmc=site_email-_-site_share-_-core-_-view_photos_button">Click here</a> for pictures of the damage from Ted and Stephanie Jensen.
