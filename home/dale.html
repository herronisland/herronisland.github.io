<p>The Herron Island Boosters wish to thank Dale and Jana Woulf for their generous donation of $500.00 to the island. They have requested this donation to be used to remove unwanted junk and debris from the island. We all appreciate their gift and wish them the best in their new residence in Arizona.
Thank you Dale and Jana for wanting to make our island a beautiful place for all to enjoy!</p>
