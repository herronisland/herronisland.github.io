(9/11/06 am) - The ferry departed on time Sunday with Captain John and Donnie.  The water was like glass and they couldn't have had a more beautiful night.  They passed under the Narrows bridge at 8:30 pm and arrived at the Tacoma dock at 10:30 pm.  John and Donnie slept on cots in the cabin overnight and moved the ferry into dry dock Monday at 7 am.  We will publish progress reports and pictures in this space as often as possible during the dry dock period.
