<h2>A Call to Herron Island Musicians!</h2>


<div align="left"><font face="arial" size="+0" color="#ffffcc"><b><br><br>


 

Imagine:  Herron Island.  It’s summertime.  It's 8 p.m. on a Saturday night.  Daylight has not left the day, but the stars are getting ready to come out and sunset begins.  Violins, tambourines, guitars, banjos and other instruments (and their owners) are gathered to have fun and enjoy the summer evening.  Yes, there's singing...and yes…that is your foot tapping to the beat and you join in.<br><br>  

 

Join us for a practice jam session once a month - on the second Saturday at 3 p.m. (Board Meeting Day).  If you love to sing and/or play an instrument, we would love to have you join us.  Our first jam session will be Saturday, April 8th.  Contact Nancy Broege (253) 884 4375 (leave a message) if you would like to join us - the location will be determined based on how many respond.
