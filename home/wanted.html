      <P>WANTED:  Your Photos of Herron Island Wildlife<br><br>

 

Do you have photos of wildlife on and in the waters around Herron Island? If so, you are invited to submit your photos to be included in naturalist presentations that I’m developing for the island next year.  Send your photos to <a href="mailto:dolphinavenues@aol.com">dolphinavenues@aol.com</a> or Dolphin Avenues PO Box 974 Lakebay WA 98349 or bring your photos to the HMC office.<br><br>  

 

Photo Requirements:  Include your name and address on all photos!  Hard copy photos will be scanned into an electronic file and returned to you. At this time only still shots are accepted.  If your photo(s) are used for one of the presentations, you will receive full credit for your photo.<br><br>

 

My goal is to teach about the wildlife in our own neighborhood.  I hope to see you at the Dolphin Avenues® Naturalist Learning Station table during a 2006 Booster Event!  Topics at the learning station will include:  Deer; Marine Mammals (whales, porpoises, sea lions; seals; sea otters, etc.); Life on the Beach (razor clams; sea stars; oysters, etc.); Raccoons; Eagles; Black Bear; Western Fence Lizards; Egrets and Others.  So, check your photo albums!<br><br>
