An HMC Member has proposed a change to our Summer ferry schedule that would add two new early morning runs on Saturday and Sunday and delete two early afternoon runs on Sunday and Monday.  No Noon runs would be affected. This change would result in some additional early morning flexibility on weekends without any additional cost to HMC.<br><br>  
The Board hopes to implement this schedule change in time for the first Saturday of the Summer schedule on April 6, 2013.  The Board would like your input on this proposed schedule change.  Please send your feedback to <a href="mailto:MemberInput@herronisland.org">MemberInput@herronisland.org</a> by March 9, 2013.  <a href="ferry_proposal_022113.pdf">Click here</a> to see the proposed changes.<br><br>

Thank you.<br><br>
