Once I Had A Neighbor . . .<br><br>
 
A Tribute To Donna Copeland<br><br>
 
Final Passage: June 2002<br><br><br>
 
 
Dear Donna,<br><br>
 
It seems like only a short time ago<br>
that I first saw you in the late afternoon sun<br>
on the property next door to me<br>
that had been vacant for so long<br><br>
 
As if I had known you forever<br>
you smiled and waved me over<br>
to one of many campfires to come<br><br>
 
A more radiantly beautiful woman<br> 
I had never met<br><br>
 
From that moment on<br>
I knew that my life on Herron Island<br>
would never be the same<br>
without you there to brighten my day<br><br>
 
I remember how happy you were<br>
on more than one occasion<br>
to surprise me by mowing my lawn<br><br>
 
When you needed a phone<br>
I always felt lucky<br>
that you wanted to use mine<br><br>
 
Long before it had a floor<br>
I loved listening to how you were going to<br>
transform your cabin<br>
into what you dreamed it would be<br><br>
 
You gave so much of yourself<br> 
to so many<br><br>
 
How is it possible that you could be<br>
so quickly taken away<br><br>
 
It is a void<br>
that can never be filled<br><br>
 
I would have given anything<br>
to keep you here<br><br>
 
You were the Fire<br>
that lights itself<br><br>
 
Love Always,<br><br>
 
Ron Lee and Friends<br>
who miss you more than words can describe<br><br><br><br>
