Many Members responded to the Board’s request for feedback concerning a proposed change to the Summer ferry schedule.  There were a total of 62 responses and of those, 60% were in favor of the change, 30% were opposed, and 10% said they liked part, but not all of proposed changes.<br><br>
  
Our Bylaws do not require a vote of the Membership to implement a change to the ferry schedule, but your Board felt it was important to seek Membership input before making a decision.  It is clear that the majority of those Members who responded were in favor of the change so at the March Board meeting the Board voted to adopt the changes with the upcoming Summer schedule effective April 1, 2013.<br><br>

At this point, the Winter Ferry Schedule remains unchanged but may be reviewed for consideration at a later date.<br><br>

This change will not generate any additional cost to HMC.<br><br>
