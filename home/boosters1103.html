<h2 align="center">Herron Island Booster Club News</h2>

<br><br>



We invite you all to join the Herron Island Boosters.   The Booster meetings are at 6:00 p.m. on the 2nd Saturday of each month and are followed by a potluck at 7:00 p.m.<br><br>

The Boosters coordinate activities for our island families.  Our goal is to make Herron Island a community with spirit by volunteering for work projects and fund raising to improve the safety and beauty of the island.  We strongly encourage family involvement with our many activities.<br><br>

Our appreciation and thanks go to the hundreds of volunteers that take on both large and small jobs that make the Boosters a success.  This past year, in addition to sponsoring the Memorial Day, 4th of July, and Labor Day weekend events, the Boosters have finished the container for storage of items that were previously stored in the community center and have poured the concrete foundation for the covered patio on the back of the community center.  The monies raised from the August 2004 Auction will be used to pay for the continuation of this project.<br><br>

Our hope is that every family on Herron Island will donate one new or nearly new item for next year’s auction.  If everyone invites their friends to the auction, it will be an even greater success than ever before!<br><br>

The new Booster Officers:<br>
