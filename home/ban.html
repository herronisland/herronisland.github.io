Burn Ban cancelled for Pierce and Snohomish counties<br><br> 

January 26, 2008 - The Stage One Burn Ban issued on January 23 for Pierce and Snohomish counties is cancelled, effective at 12:00 p.m. January 26.<br><br> 

We appreciate the public's cooperation with the burn ban, and encourage people to check current air quality conditions and air quality forecasts at our Web site <a href="http://www.pscleanair.org">www.pscleanair.org</a> before they burn. Conditions can change quickly this time of year.<br><br> 

For those who heat with wood, please remember that it is always illegal to emit excess chimney smoke and to smoke out your neighbor. You know you are burning properly when you do not see any smoke coming from your chimney. To learn more about the most efficient and cleanest burning techniques, visit <a href="http://www.burningclean.com">www.burningclean.com</a>.<br><br> 

For more information about Burn Ban regulations, you may refer to Chapter 173-433 of the Washington Administrative Code (<a href="http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/wac173433.html">http://www.ecy.wa.gov/biblio/wac173433.html</a>).<br><br> 

The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency is an air quality management agency serving King, Kitsap, Pierce and Snohomish counties. Created as a result of the 1967 Washington Clean Air Act, the agency protects public health and improves air quality by adopting and enforcing air quality regulations, educating individuals and businesses about clean-air choices and sponsoring voluntary initiatives to improve air quality.<br><br>
