    <font size="+1"><font face="Arial">Herron Island and V-CART are joining the Coast Guard's &quot;Eyes on the Sound&quot; Program. The program uses pre-identified volunteers living on or near the waters of Puget Sound to assist operations watchstanders with search and rescue cases.  Volunteers  assist Group Seattle Operation's watchstanders by being available to observe from their residence, or travel to an area of an actual or possible distress taking place, and report your findings directly to the watchstander.<br>
<br>
We already have a dozen waterfront and water-view owners who have agreed to participate!  All you have to have is a pair of binoculars and a desire to help.  When an incident is reported in our area, the Coast Guard will call the V-CART communications center.  V-CART will contact the volunteers on that side of the island and ask them to look out on the water, see what is happening, and report back to the Coast Guard.  It's that simple!  Call V-CART at 253-884-9911 to have your name added to the list, or <a href="mailto:thepetersens@compuserve.com?Subject=Eyes on the Sound">email</a> by clicking here.<br>
<br>
You don't even need to be a full-time resident to volunteer.  If we get a call on your side of the island, we'll call you.  If you aren't there, we'll call the next person on the list.  The only requirement is that you have a view of the water, or be willing to go to a place with a view of the water to take a look.<br>
