Planning is underway for our Earth Day/Parks Appreciation Day event on April 24, 2010.  This has been posted in the Beachcomber and will follow the same process as in previous years.  The one change this year is that we've combined the dock installation into this event.  Mike Shettlesworth has volunteered to do the dock repairs prior to the event.  Repair costs will be tallied and reported in our next report. <br><br> 
 
Please gather your family and friends and join us.  We've got a large list of projects and so we're hoping for a good turnout.   It's a great community event and a chance to meet some new people.<br><br> 

Meet at the Community Center at 9:00 AM.
